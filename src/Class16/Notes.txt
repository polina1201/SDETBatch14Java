Types of variables in Java with respect to their scope:
    There are 3 types of variables in Java with respect to their scope. Local, instance, and static

 Local Variables:
    If a variable is declared inside a block of a code like method, loop, if-condition, they are called Local Variables.

    Up-Side of a local variable: they exist for a very short amount of time in the memory. Which means other program
    on our computer can use that memory.

    Down-Side of a local variable: Their scope is very limited. Only inside the block in which they are created.
    We can't access them outside that block.

    When to use: We should always try to use local variable over instance variables whenever it is possible.

 Instance Variable:
    The variables which are declared inside a class, but outside of block of code.

    Up-Side: We can use these variables inside any block of code that is inside that class.
    Down-Side: They occupy the memory for longer than a local variable.

    When we should use Instance Variables:
    1)When we need to share a value between two or more methods, we should go with the instance variable.
    2)When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class, and it's possible that all the objects can
        have a different value for that variable.

  Static Variable:
    An instance variable with static keyword.

    Up-Side: we can share data across the objects with the help of static variable
    Down-Side: they occupy the memory for the longest
  When to use:
    When we want to share something across all the methods.
