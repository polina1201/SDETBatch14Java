Why we should exclude packages and class from compiling:
    In Intellij if we have a syntax error in any of the file in a project, we can't run any other file, unless
    we fix that error. Sometimes, we need to execute code in some files without fixing those issues, that's when we
    should exclude

How to Exclude Packages:
    Double click Shift button and type exclude.Hit enter from the pop-up window, click on the plus button and select
    the packages that you want to exclude. To Unexclude, from double-shift->excludes->select and click minus.

 How Java code is compiled/executed on a computer:
    We write the code in files with extension .java
    Once we hit the run button, a software program called compiler checks this code for errors
    and convert it to byte code. Usually stored in a folder called bin/out.
    JVM - another software further converts this code to binary code and this binary code is
    what executed on your computers.

 Methods in Java:
    Methods is a block of code or some Java statements grouped together.

 Why we should learn about methods:
    Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write. For example, if a piece of code
    is being repeated, we can create a method for it and simply call that method
    whenever we need that logic again.
Syntax of creating a method:
    We can create methods only inside a class.
    [datatype] [method name] [(datatype variableName)] [method body]
    [datatype] can be void boolean String int etc.
    [method name] They are like variable names.
    [(datatype variableName)] used to pass data while calling a method.

How do we decide if we should use void or a method with a return keyword
    If we are building a method that will be used by others or in other parts of your code,
    which requires some data from your method, like an if-condition, we should not create methods with
    void type.
